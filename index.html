 <h1>Quick recap on creating ZenFold</h1>
<article>
<h2>First Few Months</h2>
<p>I started ZenFold with my partner Allison late&nbsp;2015. At the time I was in the middle of my first semester teaching. I only worked on the project during free time when I felt like it. Exploring interaction models. At first the game was made up of buttons, because thats all I felt comfortable doing. Below is an image of how far the game has come, the one on the right being the older build.</p>

<h2>I only designed code</h2>
<p>One of the best experiences from ZenFold was that I designed none of it. When I was choosing what project to work on next, I wanted to see what it would be like to work on a game that I did not personally design, to execute on someone else's vision. Could I enjoy working for a company where I was to accomplish the goals of others? Turns out I like it quite a bit. I think this pushed both Allison and I to double down on our positions and make sure we spoke in a language that the other person understood. This also pushed me to make tools. Allison is a fantastic partner and designer. She is not content passing things to me for me to make. I can proudly say I didn't make a single puzzle or color pack. Tool creation was an aboslute savior on this project.</p>

<p>ZenFold is nearing completion. I am really proud of where how far its come. Of course their is a million things I'd love to add and fix. We are wrapping up the last bit of testing soon and can't wait to see people playing it. </p>
